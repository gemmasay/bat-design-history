Here’s the proposed plan for rolling out the new access controls.

The plan is to to turn on the feature after summer and the begin the process below before the next cycle.

1. Standard users will be able to continue using the service as they normally do for a period of X (to be defined) weeks.
2. We identify people from the provider that’ll be given ‘manage org/user’ permissions.
3. We send out comms to the people in (2) to tell them that they need to sign in and set up permissions by X date and the implications of not doing so.
4. When a user as defined in (2) sign in, they cannot continue until they set up permissions.
5. If X date arrives and permissions haven’t been set up then users (without the manage org/users permissions) get an interstitial/banner (to be defined) to explain why they cannot see applications. And we send out comms to users form (2) telling them the impact of what's happened and to fix it by setting up permission.

New providers can set up their permissions over the next couple of months to get ready for the start of the next cycle.
